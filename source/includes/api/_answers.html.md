  "body":"<p>Hello Zachary,</p><p>\n  <br />\n</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>1)    Firstly, you just need to make sure you have&#13;\nsales tax enabled. You can do this by clicking on the “Sales Tax” tab. If sales&#13;\ntax is not yet set up, you will see the option to “Set up sales tax”. If you&#13;\nalready have the applicable taxes for your location showing, move to step 2.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p> </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>2)    When you use one of the expense features under&#13;\nthe banking tab, you will notice that there is a sales tax column. When you&#13;\nenter the expense using the form and select the appropriate tax for that line&#13;\nitem, it will impact your tax payable (you can check by going to Company -&gt;&#13;\nChart of Accounts and double click your tax payable account). Expenses will&#13;\ndecrease your tax payable and show up as an ITC on the GST/HST detail report.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p> </p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>I hope that helps clarify :)</p>",
